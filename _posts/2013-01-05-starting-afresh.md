What better way to start the year than with a hacker clich√©; **start blogging on a regular basis**.

The Past
--------

My sum total of posts in 2012 was **ONE** and even then I ended up deleting it. This time will be different I'm promising myself. This time I'm determined to keep writing.

Looking back on my previous attempts, I only had a single post that ever gained some traction. Written back in November 2009, it was a step by step guide to building a [Hackintosh on an old Dell](http://earthview.co.uk/2009/11/install-guide-mac-os-x-snow-leopard-10-6-0-on-a-dell-dimension-9200-dxp061/) box. It still receives over 100 unique page views per month. Back in 2009 it was somewhere near the 1000 mark.

#### Analytics from December 2012

For what it's worth, that Hackintosh still works perfectly.

The Future
----------

So my aim will be to write and publish something every fortnight. I'm tempted not to include this post, so that I have until Monday 14th to produce something of value. I imagine it will along the lines of "How I Built This Blog". How original.

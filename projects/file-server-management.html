<h1>file server management tool</h1>

<p>This bash scripts connects to a server, syncs all configured folders to the local machines and sets on the local folders the defined permissions. The intention of this tool is to automate a migration or "data clone" of a Mac OS X file server, e.g. to move to a Active Directory based login mechanism.</p>

<p>The cornerstones are <code>rsync</code> and bash json reader called <a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> which is included in this repository.</p>

<p>NOTE: This script can also be used to <strong>propagate the posix and/or ACLs</strong> on a system without using the sync and share mechanism.</p>


<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

The following steps need to be done antecedent:

<ol>
    <li>rsa key creation</li>
    <ul>
        <li><code>cd ~/.ssh/</code> (goes to the default key location)</li>
        <li><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "mail address"</code> (creates a new rsa key pair)</li>
        <li><code>pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> (copies the public key to the clipboard)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>configuration of the source server</li>
    <ul>
        <li><code>vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> (edits/creates a new authorized key file)</li>
        <li>paste the clipboard (rsa public key) to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file</li>
    </ul>
    <li>changing rsync rights on the source server</li>
    <ul>
        <li><code>sudo visudo</code> (edits the sudoers)</li>
        <li><code>&gt;user&lt; ALL= NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/rsync</code> (add this to the appropriate position in the file)</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
    
    
<h2>Configuration</h2>
    
<p>The configuration file is a ```json``` file, which consists of four sections. First the ```source``` need to be defined which is the server from where you want to copy. Next thing is the ```destination``` from where you run this script and want to sync the files to. Then we have some configuration parts like ```rsa``` which holds the path to the private key created in the <a href="#preparation">preparation section</a> and the prefix for the ```log``` file.</p>
    
<p>The last section defines all the folders/shares to be synced from the source to the destination server. The ```folder``` defines the folder name on the source system, ```name``` the share name to be created. If it is empty it will use the ```folder``` name as share name. Next you define a list of ACLs. Here you define the ```group```, ```access```, and ```permission``` according to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/chmod.1.html">chmod man page</a>.</p>
    
<p>In addition you can define for each folder/share if it need to be synced from the source to the destination, if the posix or ACLs rights need to be propagated or if you want to create a share. Set for that the desired boolean value on the appropriate attribute. For more information about OS X sharing consider the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sharing.1.html">sharing man page</a>.</p>
